No matter how many times that you told me you wanted to leave
No matter how many breaths that you took you still couldn't breathe
No matter how many nights that you'd lie wide awake to the sound of the poison rain
Where did you go? Where did you go?
Where did you go?
As days go by, the night's on fire
Tell me, would you kill to save a life?
Tell me, would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash
Burn, let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground
No matter how many deaths that I die I will never forget
No matter how many lives I live I will never regret
There is a fire inside of this heart and a riot about to explode into flames
Where is your God? Where is your God?
Where is your God?
Do you really want? Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead or alive to torture for my sins?
Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead or alive to live a lie?
Tell me, would you kill to save a life?
Tell me, would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash
Burn, let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground

The promises we made were not enough (never playing the game again)
The prayers that we had prayed were like a drug (never gonna end me, yeah)
The secrets that we sold were never known (never sing a song)
The love we had, the love we had
We had to let it go
Tell me, would you kill to save a life?
Tell me, would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash
Burn, let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground
This hurricane
Oh, oh, oh-oh
This hurricane
Oh, oh, oh-oh
This hurricane
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Do you really want? Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead or alive to torture for my sins?
Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead or alive to live a lie?
